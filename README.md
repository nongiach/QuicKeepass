Why? Why? Why? Why security should be a trade of with usability?
I actually think that we can design softwares that are secure and ergonomic.
QuicKeepass for instance allows you to quickly paste any of your passwords from keepass with only two keyboard hits,
QuicKeepass doesn't add attack surface to your keepass, it simply automates your keepass usage using pykeepass python wrapper.
No secrets are stored outside of your keepass, your passwords are safe and your master password too.
